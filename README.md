# Tic-Tac-Toe

> We built a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

> Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

- You can enter minimum two characters of your name to move forward
- The first player will play with 'X' and the other with 'O'
- It will be player turnwise, Player 1 goes first, then Player 2, then again Player 1, likewise until you reach the following condition
- For winning this game, one has to create a row/column/diagonal of three "X"s or "O"s first
- If no one will be able to make so, it will be a tie and will ask for continuing another match or quit the game
