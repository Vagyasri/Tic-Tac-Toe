# Tic-Tac-Toe

> We built a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

> Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
